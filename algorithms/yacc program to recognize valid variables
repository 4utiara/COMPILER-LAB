YACC PROGRAM TO RECOGNIZE VALID VARIABLES
AIM
To write a YACC program to recognize a valid variable which starts with a letter followed by any
number of letters or digits.
ALGORITHM
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. The program begins in main() where the user is prompted to input a string.
yyparse() is called to start the parsing process.
The lexical analyzer identifies tokens based on patterns: letter for identifiers and digit for
numbers.
The lexer returns letter for [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* and digit for [0-9] to the YACC
parser.
The parser uses the CFG rules:
 start → letter s
 s → letter s | digit s | ε
The parser checks if the input follows these rules, defining valid identifiers starting with a
letter.
If the input matches the CFG, the parsing continues successfully.
If the input violates the CFG, yyerror() is called, setting valid = 0 and printing an error
message.
After parsing, main() checks the valid flag.
10. If valid, it prints "It is an identifier"; otherwise, it prints an error message.
RESULT
Successfully run the program and obtained desired output.
